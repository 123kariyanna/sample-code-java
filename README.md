# Sample Code for the Authorize.Net Java SDK
The goal of this code sample repository is to provide completely self-contained autonomous examples of using our Java SDK to access the Authorize.Net API.  We have tested all the samples and while we expect that many people will copy/paste them into their own development projects they are also idependently runnable from the command line.

## Set Up Steps
* Clone this repository.
* Run "mvn package" in the root directory.
* Run the individual samples e.g. 

java -jar target/VisaCheckoutDecrypt-jar-with-dependencies.jar


## API Reference
The code samples are organized just like our API reference which you can access here http://developer.authorize.net/api/reference

*PLEASE NOTE THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT*
